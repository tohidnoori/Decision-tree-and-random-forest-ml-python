# Decision-Tree and Random-Forest Ml-Python

**Decision Tree**, a supervised learning for classification and regression, is used for basic data analysis.
<br/><br/>
**Random forest** is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm, that combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result.
It covers some disadvantages of a simple decison tree by it randomness behavior.
<br/>
<br/>
For this experiment, I used Jupter Notebook, a web-based interactive computing platform, and the well-known Python module scikit-learn.
I also write the decision tree classifier by my self and compare it to the python library one,and I use Gini impurity instead of entropy in the information gain section.
